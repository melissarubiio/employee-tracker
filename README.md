# Employee Tracker

## Description
This application is made to track employees all through the terminal. I tried to install mysql and and inquire package and it worked but once it came to node index it came with an error about ES Lint and I could not resolve it. I hope to have fixed this in the future. In the repository you can see my code that I tried changing to make it functional. UPDATE: I was able to get the inquire to work, the mock up image below shows what the terminal displays after you node server.
